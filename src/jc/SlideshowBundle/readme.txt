Allows to manage slideshow for website.

This bundle requires database 'slideshow' and 'picture' (see SQL in 'Resources/public/database' directory).

Each slideshow defines pictures which that can be sorted.

Pictures are uploaded in specific folder '/userfiles/slideshow'. You can change this path in 'Resources/config/services.yml' file.

NOTE : Add script 'Resources/public/js/slideshow.js' in website's resources ('/web/resources/js') and include this script to load slideshow using ajax.
